My research investigates the intersection of writing studies and data science paradigms---focusing on the importance of programming and software development as they motivate the ongoing expansion of research methods in media ecology and the posthumanities. Grounded primarily in the study of trend circulation among social networks, my research interests also include professional and technical writing, the rhetoric of science, and maker culture.

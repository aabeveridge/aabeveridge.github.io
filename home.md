My research investigates the intersection of data science and humanities research paradigms--focusing on the importance of tool creation and software development as they motivate the ongoing expansion of available methods in the posthumanities. Grounded primarily in writing studies and circulation studies, my research interests also include technical writing, the rhetoric of science, and maker culture.

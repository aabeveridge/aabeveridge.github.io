My research investigates the intersection of writing studies and data science research paradigms---focusing on the importance of programming and software development as they motivate the ongoing expansion of available methods in media ecology and the posthumanities. Grounded primarily in circulation studies, my research interests also include professional and technical writing, the rhetoric of science, and maker culture.

<p>Often, the context and history of particular technological innovations matter little once they have been normalized into everyday life. How many writers know the history of word processor software or the choices behind its development? Many writers remain unaware of this history because it is inconsequential to the function of the tool. The Internet has brought about rapid and ongoing development of writing software during the last twenty years. The most recent of which are cloud writing technologies that function ubiquitously within any Internet browser--allowing users to access their writing on any web-connected device. Yet, given these ongoing developments, many writers still rely on standalone installations of word processing software, and Microsoft Word remains the primary mainstay for writers. In writing and rhetoric, most major journals continue to request a document formatted with Microsoft’s proprietary format: DOCX. There have been many challenges to Microsoft’s word-processing monopoly. Open Office and Libre Office are two freely available applications that offer similar functionality to Word, but the open source nature of their development has done little to affect the broader problem affecting word processor software: WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get; pronounced: wizzy-wig) software hides typesetting syntax and formatting code in order to allow users to write in an environment that closely resembles their document’s final form. Newer WYSIWYG writing environments such as Scrivener, Google Docs, Evernote, or minimalist software such as WriteRoom, do little alleviate the problems inherent to WYSIWYG production.</p>

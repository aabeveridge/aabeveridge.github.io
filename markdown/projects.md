#MLA JIL Data Analysis  
I am curating an archive of job description data and writing studies
related analyses from the MLA Jobs Information List (JIL). I am
analyzing the data for word frequencies and correlations related to the
terms: “rhetoric,” “composition,” “writing,” and “technical.” This
project is currently “in-progress,” but all of the code and data are
available through my [GitHub page for the MLA JIL data
project](https://github.com/aaronbev79/mla_data).

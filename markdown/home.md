With a focus on text mining, natural language processing, and data visualization, I am excited to contribute to the ongoing expansion of data-driven methods in rhetoric and composition. My research and teaching interests also include cultural analytics, media ecology, the rhetoric of science, maker culture, and technical communication.</p>

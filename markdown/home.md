With a focus on text mining, natural language processing, and data visualization, I am excited to contribute to the ongoing expansion of data-driven methods in rhetoric and writing studies. Grounded primarily in the study of networked writing and the circulation of digital artifacts, my research and teaching interests also include media ecology, the rhetoric of science, maker culture, and technical communication.</p>

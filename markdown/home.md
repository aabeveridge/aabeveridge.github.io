<p><img src="./images/headshot1_tiny.jpg" align="left" style="display:inline;margin:6px 14px 0px 10px;"/>My research intersects writing studies and data science paradigms. With a focus on programming, natural language processing, and data visualization, my work contributes to the ongoing expansion of data-driven methods in rhetoric and writing studies. Grounded primarily in the study of networked writing and trend circulation, my research and teaching interests also include technical communication, the rhetoric of science, media ecology, and maker culture.</p>

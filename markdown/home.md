<p><img src="./images/headshot1_tiny.jpg" align="left" style="display:inline;margin:6px 14px 0px 10px;"/>My research intersects writing studies and data science paradigms. With a focus on programming, data mining, and data visualization, I am excited to contribute to the ongoing expansion of digital research methods in rhetoric and writing studies. Grounded primarily in the study of networked writing and trend circulation, my research interests also include technical communication, the rhetoric of science, media ecology, and maker culture.</p>

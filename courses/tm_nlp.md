# Text Mining and Natural Language Processing [IAL 620]

## Overview
As a core course in the Cultural Analytics concentration for the MS of Informatics and Analytics at UNCG, IAL 620 explores and complicates a simple question: how do we extract the most important information or meaning from a collection of documents (corpus)? Obviously, answers to questions of "importance" and "meaning" are framed by the scholar asking the question and the inherent limitations in the data explored. In this case, the primary form of data will be text--words and phrases, how they are interrelated, and the documents in which they are contained.

## Tools and Technologies Needed for Course
- R programming language
- Atom text editor
- R packages
  - Tidyverse
  - Rvest
  - R markdown

## Texts
- *Where Wizards Stay Up Late**
- *Text Mining with R*

## Schedule
All courses for the Cultural Analytics concentration maintain a 12 week schedule, and this allows the final 3 weeks (weeks 13-15) to be dedicated to the final projects for the course. The final projects act as the final for each course, but these projects also allow students to experiment with potential projects they may pursue during their Capstone for the MSIA program.

# Text Mining and Natural Language Processing [IAL 620]

## Overview
As a core course in the Cultural Analytics concentration for the MS of Informatics and Analytics at UNCG, IAL 620 explores and complicates a simple question: how do we extract the most important information or meaning from a collection of documents (corpus)? Obviously, answers to questions of "importance" and "meaning" are framed by the scholar asking the question and the inherent limitations in the data explored. In this case, the primary form of data will be text--words and phrases, how they are interrelated, and the documents in which they are contained.

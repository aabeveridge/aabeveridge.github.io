# Content Analysis for Social Network Data [IAL 621]

## Overview
As a core course in the Cultural Analytics concentration for the MS of Informatics and Analytics at UNCG, IAL 620 explores and complicates a simple question: how do we determine the most engaging or relevant content in a digital network (or, among a group of users within a network)? Obviously, answers to questions of "engagement" and "relevance" are framed by the researcher who asking the questions and by the inherent limitations in the networks explored. For this course, we will focus on Twitter content--tweets--and the text, images, videos, URLs, and other content those tweets contain. However, students may also explore other networks and content depending on the project they propose for the course.  

## Student Learning Objectives
- Recognize and apply data-driven methods to analyze trends and audiences on Twitter
- Recognize relevant issues pertaining to individual privacy rights and intellectual property for social network data
- Identify and discriminate among various methodologies for describing trends and for measuring audience engagement in social networks

## Assignments
- Project Proposal -- 20%
- Tutorials (code and documentation) -- 20%
- Workshops (weekly progress on course projects) -- 20%
- Ethics Paper -- 10%
- Tests -- 10%
- Final Presentation (final report on course projects) -- 20%

## Tools and Technologies Needed for Course
- R programming language
- MassMine
- Atom text editor
- R packages
  - Tidyverse
  - R markdown

## Texts
- Selected readings from *Diffusion of Innovations* and *Networks, Crowds, and Markets*

## Schedule
All courses for the Cultural Analytics concentration maintain a 12 week schedule, and this allows the final 3 weeks (weeks 13-15) to be dedicated to workshops for the final projects in the course. The final projects act as the "final" for each course, but these projects also allow students to experiment with potential projects they may pursue during their Capstone for the MSIA program.
